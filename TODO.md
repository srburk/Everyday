## Completed:
- ~~Settings page on top left header button as a modal sheet. Include options to view the recently deleted habits from the SQL archive and the time left before permanent deletion (use a 30 day policy). Implement hooks or some mechanism for other pages to use the settings~~
- ~~Implement 30-day deletion policy for archived habits~~
- ~~Reorder habits on main habit page~~ (long-press to drag)
- ~~Edit page for habits instead of high-level delete option on habit page. Edit page should also let you adjust name, color, and icon. Deletion should trigger a layout refresh of the habits list page.~~
- ~~Icon picker for habits. Show color and icon on the habits list page.~~

## TODO:
- Auto-sort completed habits to bottom (make this a setting but on by default)
  - Note: Implementation exists on `feature/auto-sort-completed` branch but not merged - difficult to test without manual verification
- High level anchored card on habits page showing general streak progress across habits
- More detailed heatmap view you can tap into from lower habit detail view
